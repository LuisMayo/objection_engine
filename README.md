This is a fork of a wonderful [Reddit bot](https://github.com/micah5/ace-attorney-reddit-bot)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

 - Python 3 with pip
 - FFMPEG instalation. In most Linux distros it should be available in the default package manager. In Windows systems it'd include downloading a [pre-compiled zip folder](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows), extracting it and adding the /bin folder into the [system path](https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-10/add-windows-path-environment-variable/)

#### Optional
 - [Google Translation API Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/setup): These are needed for language support other than English. Other languages may work even without this credentials as the system will fallback to TextBlob's translation system.

Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/LuisMayo/objection_engine
```

(optional) In case you want language support outside English install polyglot and its dependencies:
(if on windows check faq.md)

```bash
